## Introduction

ForeScore is the easy to way play games on the golf course. This app allows players to easily create matches with their friends, play games,and track payouts.

<br/>
<br/>

## Why Am I Building This app?

Traditonal scorecards quickly get cluttered with gross scores and net scores, and determing payout can quickly get messy. ForeScore provides a solution. Most other apps out there dont allow for easy scoring with friends, and allow only individual gross scoring. If apps do allow multiplayer scoring and games, the UIs are difficult to use and outdated. With ForeScore I hope to provide a modern scoring interface that allow players to step up to the teebox without any stress about scoring their rounds. Simply enter a players gross score and let the app take care of the rest.

Watch a demo first here: [Demo](#demo)

You can try the app here at this repository where you will see instructions on how to access it:  https://github.com/georgebjork/georgebjork.github.io

<br/> 
(Please note that this app does not have user auth implemented. Matches are not yet tied to users and the friends and favorite course lists are just the players in the database already. This will be a change coming very soon.)
