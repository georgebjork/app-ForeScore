## Introduction

ForeScore is the easy to way play games on the golf course. This app allows players to easily create matches with their friends, play games,and track payouts.

<br/>
<br/>

## Why Am I Building This app?

Traditional scorecards quickly get cluttered with gross scores and net scores and determining payout can quickly get messy. ForeScore provides a solution. Most other apps out there don't allow for easy scoring with friends and allow only individual gross scoring. If apps do allow multiplayer scoring and games, the UIs are difficult to use and outdated. With ForeScore I hope to provide a modern scoring interface that allows players to step up to the tee box without any stress about scoring their rounds. Simply enter a player's gross score and let the app take care of the rest.

## Try the app now

Watch a demo first here: [Demo](#demo) 

<br/>

You can try the app here at this repository where you will see instructions on how to access it:  https://github.com/georgebjork/georgebjork.github.io

<br/> 
(Please note that this app does not have user auth implemented. Matches are not yet tied to users and the friends and favorite course lists are just the players in the database already. This will be a change coming very soon.)

## Demo

Before watching: 

This video demonstrates implemented features and features in progress. You will see me skip to the end of the round. Once Hole 18 is reached, you will see a finish button appear. This will then take us to the round summary page which is still a work in progress as you will see. You will also notice on the scorecard page, it shows match id 282. You can also view that match scorecard here: https://tgin-mvc.azurewebsites.net/match/282
